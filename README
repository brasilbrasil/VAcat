An R package designed to work with Bayesian categorical models
to conduct a plant vulnerability assessment. Specifically using
the R package 'catnet' with functions to translate back and
forth with the format used by GeNiE.

The directory is formatted as an R package for local installation.
The source code files include function descriptions formatted
for the roxygen2 library to automatically generate manual pages
(in the /man directory). If we're going to install this directly
from github we'll need to run roxygenise() before uploading.
