Re-named output to "Species status"
	 Changed identifier to "Sp_status"
Added "Assumed stable" as intermediate value to Current pop trend
Colored Current pop trend green
Added "Widespread" as new level for Number of populations
      Note: Define widespread species based on number of island it is
      historically known to occur (most islands). or use biogeographic
      regions

### To do:
Generalize "pollination" language to apply to fern spore propagation?
