## Demography: Survival
Removed protective status
Removed C4 / CAM as parent to drought tolerance
	Did *not* place it anywhere else
Re-named Disturbance sensitivity as "Abiotic disturbance response"
	 Identifier re-named as "Abiotic_dist_resp"
Relative storm tolerance re-named to High wind tolerant
	 ID: Wind_tolerant
Relative flood tolerance re-named to Inundation tolerant
	 ID: Inund_tolerant
Relative drought tolerance re-named to Drought tolerant
	 ID: Drought_tolerant
Relative fire tolerance re-named to Fire tolerant
	 ID: Fire_tolerant
All four of the above states re-named to "Yes" and "No"
Linked Age of 1st reproduction directly to "Evolve" response
Removed link between Demography: Survival and Evolve response


## Demography: Population numbers
Re-named output to "Species status"
	 Changed identifier to "Sp_status"
Added "Assumed stable" as intermediate value to Current pop trend
Colored Current pop trend green
Added "Widespread" as new level for Number of populations
      Note: Define widespread species based on number of island it is
      historically known to occur (most islands). or use biogeographic
      regions

### To do:
Generalize "pollination" language to apply to fern spore propagation?
