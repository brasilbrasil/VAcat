TO DO:
For group to give input:
-What other big picture factors are we missing?
-Which other links of current threats to submodel outcomes?
-Remove population density from population submodel?
-Breeding success: now only dependent on pollination success. Is that enough??
-Habitat specialization: interspecific dependence: is that all inclusive?

For us to decide now:
-Review all possible links between submodels and responses
-Problem with demography submodel: some of the submodels impact
different responses (e.g., reproduction impacts mostly migrate
and evolution, not tolerate)
-Dispersal and movement impacts migrate mostly. Is it ok that
nesting hides these differences? At a minimum, should dispersal
be separated from demography?
-Revise geographic model: simplify them!
-Water dispersal: Just ask experts for which species, instead of using complex set of factors to infer info?


DONE:
-Decided not to add "Mixed" to pollinator type? (KB)
-Wind dispersal: wind-adapted shape, number of propagules and small seed/ fruit size
-reworded colony survivals to establishment success
-Added intoduced animal dispersers as parent to Biotic dispersal potential
-Dispersal vector now has 2 states (bio/ abio)
-Removed insect dispersal agent
-Added Ocean drift and Stream dispersal as parents to Avg. dispersal distance
-Colored switch factors to grey (25%)
-In survival, added a protected status node as co-parent of adult and
pre-reproductive survival, child of protected status in the three
response zone quality sub-models
-Added (pink) sympatry node to genetic diversity
-Added effective population size as child of microsatellite diversity
-Re-colored habitat quality: Tolerance
-Phenotypic plasticity also made a parent of Tolerate
-Moved historical population density to Genetic diversity, made it
co-parents to Past Bottle Necks with Current population density
-Colored all nodes and sub-models as Green-Yellow-Pink
-Added self-compatible and Pre-reproductive survival as parents to "Colony survival"
-Renamed disturbance to "Disturbance sensitvity" and made it a parent
of Demography: Survival
-Simplified disturbance to four parants: Drought, Flood, Storm, Fire
-Moved C4 vs C3 to parent of drought tolerance
-Added indigenous/endogenous to evolutionary history child
-Current population number as child of population density
-Perhaps add to niche specialization: Nitrogen fixing neighbors (ask Stephanie?)? Epiphyte, mutualism, etc
-Move general disturbance factors (top) to niche specialization
-Add preferential seed predation by invasives to reproduction submodel
-Add preferential browsing by invasive animals to survival submodel (i.e., icecream plants)
-Switch gen lenth in order with age of first reprod.
-Remove link between structure and migrate
-Remove interspecific interaction, but must make caveat in assessment
-Do not include extraction/ harvest: Not too big issue



PAST RESOLVED ISSUES:
Disturbance: What are factors related to relative drought, flood, fire, storm tolerance?
Disturbance: How to calculate changes in drought, flood, fire, storm disturbance?
Physical structure: agree but must be careful that all factors have clear positive/ negative link to responses

Habitat specialization: What are other factors that are relevant?
Habitat specialization: Climate zone is already redundant
Habitat specialization: Persistence on degraded habitat/ dependence on protected habitat are nearly equivalent
Habitat specialization: could some nodes from disturbance submodel fit
here? Purpose of this submodel is to determine how specific are the
conditions necessary for the species to thrive. If a species requires
gaps, shaded understory o other structural, species facilitation, this
is important; also epiphyte (?)


Interspecific interaction submodel needs a lot of work: Is there another way to get at inter specific interactions? The way submodel is currently configured, we will likely have nothing to say about it for most species

Dispersal: colony survival either a child of survival, or remove it
and make survival a parent of migration response -- instead gave it
self-compatibility as a parent
