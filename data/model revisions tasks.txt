TO DO:
-Finalize color scheme: Green: confident; Pink: uncertain
-Move parts of disturbance into survival submodel
-What other big picture factors are we missing?
-Review all possible links between submodels and responses
-Which other links of current threats to submodel outcomes?
-Problem with demography submodel: some of the submodels impact different responses (e.g., reproduction impacts mostly migrate and evolution, not tolerate)
 Dispersal and movement impacts migrate mostly. Is it ok that nesting hides these differences? At a minimum, should dispersal be separated from
 demography?
-Revise geographic model: simplify them!
-Move C4 vs C3 to node about drought tolerance?
-Dispersal: colony survival either a child of survival, or remove it and make survival a parent of migration response
-Remove population density from population submodel?
-Breeding success: now only dependent on pollination success
-Habitat specilization: interspecific dependence: is that all inclusive?
-Historical population density (Sakai info): where else may it fit better
-Structure: C4/CAM and phenotipic plasticity do not fit exactly in submodel
-Add self-pollination and dioecy as parents to "Colony survival"
-Add current and past population density as parents to Past bottle necks


DONE:
-Added indigenous/endogenous to evolutionary history child
-Current population number as child of population density
-Perhaps add to niche specialization: Nitrogen fixing neighbors (ask Stephanie?)? Epiphyte, mutualism, etc
-Move general disturbance factors (top) to niche specialization
-Add preferential seed predation by invasives to reproduction submodel
-Add preferential browsing by invasive animals to survival submodel (i.e., icecream plants)
-Switch gen lenth in order with age of first reprod.
-Remove link between structure and migrate
-Remove interspecific interaction, but must make caveat in assessment
-Do not include extraction/ harvest: Not too big issue







PAST RESOLVED ISSUES:
Disturbance: What are factors related to relative drought, flood, fire, storm tolerance?
Disturbance: How to calculate changes in drought, flood, fire, storm disturbance?
Physical structure: agree but must be careful that all factors have clear positive/ negative link to responses

Habitat specialization: What are other factors that are relevant?
Habitat specialization: Climate zone is already redundant
Habitat specialization: Persistence on degraded habitat/ dependence on protected habitat are nearly equivalent
Habitat specialization: could some nodes from disturbance submodel fit here? Purpose of this submodel is to determine how specific are the conditions necessary for the species to thrive. If a species requires gaps, shaded understory o other structural, species facilitation, this is important; also epiphyte (?)

Interspecific interaction submodel needs a lot of work: Is there another way to get at inter specific interactions? The way submodel is currently configured, we will likely have nothing to say about it for most species
