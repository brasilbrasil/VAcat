TO DO:
-Finalize color scheme: Green: confident; Pink: uncertain
-Move parts of disturbance into survival submodel
-Perhaps add to niche specialization: Nitrogen fixing neighbors (ask Stephanie?)? Epiphyte, mutualism, etc
-What other big picture factors are we missing?
-Which other links of current threats to submodel outcomes?
-Revise geographic model: simplify them!


DONE:
-Move general disturbance factors (top) to niche specialization
-Add preferential seed predation by invasives to reproduction submodel
-Add preferential browsing by invasive animals to survival submodel (i.e., icecream plants)
-Switch gen lenth in order with age of first reprod.
-Remove link between structure and migrate
-Remove interspecific interaction, but must make caveat in assessment
-Do not include extraction/ harvest: Not too big issue







PAST RESOLVED ISSUES:
Disturbance: What are factors related to relative drought, flood, fire, storm tolerance?
Disturbance: How to calculate changes in drought, flood, fire, storm disturbance?
Physical structure: agree but must be careful that all factors have clear positive/ negative link to responses

Habitat specialization: What are other factors that are relevant?
Habitat specialization: Climate zone is already redundant
Habitat specialization: Persistence on degraded habitat/ dependence on protected habitat are nearly equivalent
Habitat specialization: could some nodes from disturbance submodel fit here? Purpose of this submodel is to determine how specific are the conditions necessary for the species to thrive. If a species requires gaps, shaded understory o other structural, species facilitation, this is important; also epiphyte (?)

Interspecific interaction submodel needs a lot of work: Is there another way to get at inter specific interactions? The way submodel is currently configured, we will likely have nothing to say about it for most species
